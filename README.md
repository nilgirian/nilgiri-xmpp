Project: xmpp-client
1,621 lines of Java code.

This project allowed people to play Nilgiri MUD straight from an instant
messanger client via XMPP. The Google variant worked fairly well at the time.
The Facebook variant had some issues.

This code isn't packaged to be readily runnable and is meant to interface
specifically with a version of Nilgiri.
